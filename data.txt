United Kingdom Highlights
CP Tech International kicked off back in 2019, right in the heart of Manchester a city famous for its bold spirit and no-nonsense attitude. Starting out as a small, local outfit, we had a clear goal to redefine modern vaping for everyday vapers across the UK.

At a time when the market was absolutely swamped, we noticed something was missing: proper quality, honest flavours, and a real connection with the vaping community. We weren’t just another brand we wanted to build something people could truly trust, with consistency and innovation at its core.

From the get go, we were hands-on perfecting flavours, tweaking designs, and building relationships with vapers who know their stuff. Whether you’re after a smooth MTL draw, a decent cloud chucker, or a solid all day vape , we’re committed to delivering top notch kit and liquids that hit the spot every time.

Our UK operations run from our warehouse at Unit 2, Euro House, 1 Overbridge Road, Salford, Manchester M7 1SL, where a tight knit team of 6 to 7 experts handle everything from stock and shipping to customer support with proper pride.

Though we’ve grown far and wide, Manchester’s still where it’s at for us. It’s the place that keeps us grounded and sharp, driving us to push boundaries and deliver vaping gear that’s made by vapers, for vapers.

Spain
Spain Highlights
By 2021, CP Tech International was gaining serious traction and then came the game changer the launch of our now iconic Crystal Pro series. What started as a product quickly became a movement across Europe. Crystal Pro didn’t just introduce a new device it redefined the vaping experience for thousands.
The response? Masivo.
Vapers across the continent embraced the design, flavour, and power calling it “el vaporizador que lo cambió todo.”
To keep up with the skyrocketing demand and deliver faster, smarter service, we made a bold move:
We set up our own distribution hub right here in Spain, under the name:
Rzvapeseurope SL, Calle Bismark 43, Local 08024, Barcelona.
Our fully operational facility, powered by a dedicated team of 10–12 members, now keeps the flow of product moving daily from Barcelona to the rest of Europe. This wasn’t just about logistics fue una declaración. It was about planting real roots in Europe.
Then came 2022, and with it, a global wave of recognition. With a strong product lineup and a growing rep for quality, CP Tech International expanded deeper into international markets from trade expos to retail shelves, and everywhere in between.
Spain quickly became more than just a distribution point
It became a gateway.
A launchpad.
A place where “calidad global y pasión local” come together.
Today, our presence in Spain is more than strategic
Es parte de nuestra historia, powered by our local team and driven by a relentless commitment to innovación, excelencia y sabor auténtico.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan Highlights
In 2024, CP Tech International officially touched down in Pakistan, bringing with it a bold new vision: to make premium, globally trusted vaping products accessible to every corner of the country.
We launched with a bang unveiling a powerful online store offering nationwide delivery, making it easier than ever for customers across Pakistan to experience the quality and innovation we’re known for. But we didn’t stop there.
That same year, we opened the doors to three flagship outlets right in the heart of Islamabad more than just stores, they became spaces for community, education, and experience. Whether it’s first-time users or long time enthusiasts, our outlets were designed to offer hands on guidance, local support, and global-grade products under one roof.
This expansion wasn’t just business it was personal. With deep regional insights and a commitment to quality, we’ve built a bridge between global standards and local convenience, reshaping how vaping is experienced in Pakistan.
And we’re just getting started.
